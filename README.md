# XamFormsSample
This is a very plain, blank, Xamarin.Forms app I use as a starting point to create examples and reproduce bugs I run into during development.

My hope is that I'll reduce the time it takes me to spin up a sample that either proves a concept or reproduces a bug by having this app to start from.
